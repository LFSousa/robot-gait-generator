# Robot Gait Generator

[Preview](https://lfsousa.github.io/robot-gait-generator "Preview the code in GitHub")

I'm studing for a college project that involves the use of Machine Learning to generate the best gaits to move a quadruped and avoid obstacles. 
This algorithm was the first step to preview if the robot structure could do what it was suposed to do. It connects to the robot using socket-io and pass the four servos angles, so I can test if the steps are doing good.
